## 🔥 Employee Burnout Analysis
   Employee burnout negatively impacts productivity, job satisfaction, and workplace well-being. This project aims to analyze and predict burnout risks using machine learning, focusing on key factors like workload and work-life balance.
This project mainly leverages a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of employee burnout based on key workplace and behavioral factors.

### 📝 Overview
- **Purpose**: Identify potential burnout risks among employees to enable proactive HR interventions.
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression (pre-trained and saved as `EBA_LR.pkl`).
- **Key Features**:
  - Satisfaction Level
  - Last Evaluation Score
  - Number of Projects
  - Average Monthly Hours
  - Time Spent at Company
  - Work Accident (Yes/No)
  - Promotion in Last 5 Years (Yes/No)
- **Output**: Binary prediction (`0` for not burnt out, `1` for burnt out).

### 🚀 Web Interface
The project includes a Streamlit-powered web application (`EBAapp.py`) where users can input employee data and get immediate burnout predictions.
